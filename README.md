# Titanic EDA

An EDA of a classic Titanic dataset.

## Technologies:
- pandas.

## Key insights:
- Some columns have missing values, especially age, cabin, and body.
- 121 bodies were found after the accident.
- Most passengers died — only about 38% survived.
- Most survivors were women and children.
- Adult men had a much lower chance of survival.
- Most surviving men were between 18 and 35 years old.
- There are no strong connections (correlations) between the columns.
- Some people had ticket prices equal to 0 — maybe they got free or group tickets.
